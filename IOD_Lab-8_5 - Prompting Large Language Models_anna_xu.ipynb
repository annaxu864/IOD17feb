    "# Lab 8.5 - Prompting Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will practise prompting with a few Large Language Models (LLMs) using Groq (not to be confused with Grok). Groq is a platform that provides access to their custom-built AI hardware via APIs, allowing users to run open-source models such as Llama.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall see that while LLMs are powerful tools, how you ask a question or frame a task can dramatically influence the results obtained."

    "SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook the San Francisco area Friday at 4:42 a.m. PT (7:42 a.m. ET), the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake left about 2,000 customers without power, said David Eisenhower, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Light. Under the USGS classification, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake is considered \"light,\" which it says usually causes minimal damage. \"We had quite a spike in calls, mostly calls of inquiry, none of any injury, none of any damage that was reported,\" said Capt. Al Casciato of the San Francisco police. \"It was fairly mild.\" Watch police describe concerned calls immediately after the quake » . The quake was centered about two miles east-northeast of Oakland, at a depth of 3.6 miles, the USGS said. Oakland is just east of San Francisco, across San Francisco Bay. An Oakland police dispatcher told CNN the quake set off alarms at people's homes. The shaking lasted about 50 seconds, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. According to the USGS, magnitude 4.2 quakes are felt indoors and may break dishes and windows and overturn unstable objects. Pendulum clocks may stop.\n",

       "The way two chemicals react depends on the specific chemical properties and the conditions in which they interact. Here are the general steps involved in a chemical reaction:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Collision**: Two molecules (atoms or ions) must collide with each other. The likelihood of a collision depends on the concentration and movement of the molecules.\n",
       "2. **Orientation**: The molecules must be oriented in a way that allows them to interact. This is influenced by the shape and polarity of the molecules.\n",
       "3. **Energy**: The molecules must have enough energy to overcome the repulsive forces between them and form a new bond.\n",
       "4. **Reaction**: If the molecules meet the above conditions, a chemical reaction occurs, resulting in the formation of new products.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are several types of chemical reactions, including:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Synthesis**: Two or more molecules combine to form a new molecule.\n",
       "Example: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O\n",
       "2. **Decomposition**: A single molecule breaks down into simpler molecules.\n",
       "Example: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2\n",
       "3. **Single displacement**: One element displaces another element from a compound.\n",
       "Example: Zn + CuSO4 → ZnSO4 + Cu\n",
       "4. **Double displacement**: Two compounds exchange partners.\n",
       "Example: NaCl + AgNO3 → NaNO3 + AgCl\n",
       "5. **Combustion**: A molecule reacts with oxygen to release energy.\n",
       "Example: CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O\n",
       "\n",
       "To predict how two chemicals will react, you can use the following factors:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Electronegativity**: The tendency of an atom to attract electrons.\n",
       "2. **Polarity**: The distribution of electrons within a molecule.\n",
       "3. **Reactivity series**: A list of elements arranged by their reactivity.\n",
       "4. **Acid-base properties**: The ability of a molecule to donate or accept a proton.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's essential to note that predicting chemical reactions involves a complex interplay of these factors and requires a strong understanding of chemistry principles."

To conquer the floor.\\n\\nHe couldn't quite understand why his legs refused to move as one. The world was a fascinating place, just out of reach – fluffy rugs begging to be crawled upon, a sparkly mobile dangling enticingly, and the elusive comfort of Mom's lap. \\n\\nOne sunny afternoon, while his chubby fingers tugged at a dangling teething toy, an idea, bright and unyielding as the sun shining through the nursery window, struck Bartholomew. He pushed himself up, his eyebrows furrowing in concentration, and let out a triumphant gurgle. This, he decided, was the key.\\n\\nFor the next few hours, Bartholomew \"skated\" – a wobbly, jerky motion fueled by desperation and mashed sweet potato-induced energy. He propelled himself across the floor, arms flailing like windmill wings, legs kicking blindly. \\n\\nEach failed attempt resulted in a frustrating topple, met with tears that were swiftly soothed by a cooing melody from Mom, followed by gentle pats and encouraging \"good tries.\" \\n\\nFrustration was brewing. He wanted to be like his older sister, Lily, who glided across the floor like a gazelle on ice skates. But Bartholomew wasn't a gazelle. He was a Buttercup, and Buttercups, he decided, were meant to conquer the world, one wobbly crawl at a time.\\n\\nHe took a deep breath, remembering the way his sister moved. He watched her, his big brown eyes full of determination. \\n\\nSlowly, methodically, he began to coordinate his movements. One hand reached out, pushing against the rug. The other, mirroring the action, found purchase on the wooden floor. His legs, finally understanding their role, pushed down with surprising strength. \\n\\nHe felt a surge of triumph as he moved – not a jerky skate, but a smooth, controlled crawl. He was moving! He was conquering!\\n\\nA roar of glee erupted from his tiny throat. His legs pumped, propelling him across the room. He was a speedboat on a sunny sea, navigating the world with newfound freedom.\\n\\nHe stopped short, realizing his destination. Mom sat on the floor, a book open in her lap, humming a soft tune. \\n\\nWith a final burst of energy, Bartholomew reached her, collapsing into her open arms. \\n\\n\"Yay, Bartholomew!\" Mom exclaimed, her voice filled with pride. \"You crawled!\"\\n\\nBartholomew gurgled happily, his face flushed with exertion and triumph. He had conquered the floor. But more importantly, he had conquered the doubt, proving to himself that even the smallest Buttercup could achieve anything they set their mind to.

Luna was a bundle of energy, always moving, always exploring, and always getting into mischief. But there was one thing that Luna hadn't mastered yet: crawling.\\n\\nEvery day, Luna would watch her older siblings as they played, laughed, and crawled on all fours. She'd try to join in, but her little arms and legs would flail and flop, and she'd end up on her bottom, giggling.\\n\\nLuna's mom, Emma, would kneel down beside her and say, \"Don't worry, little one. You'll get it eventually.\" But Luna was determined to learn. She practiced and practiced, using the couch cushions as her launching pad to try and reach the toys on the floor.\\n\\nOne day, Emma had an idea. She grabbed a few colorful blankets and spread them out in front of Luna, creating a mini obstacle course. \"Try crawling over these, Luna!\" she exclaimed. Luna's eyes widened as she gazed at the blankets. This was the challenge she'd been waiting for.\\n\\nWith a determined look on her face, Luna started to move. At first, it was more like a flop than a crawl. Her arms and legs flailed wildly, and she fell onto her bottom with a tiny oof. But Emma was patient, cheering her on, \"Keep going, Luna! You're doing it!\"\\n\\nUndeterred, Luna tried again. This time, she managed to push herself forward with one hand and drag her other leg behind her. Then, suddenly, she found herself on all fours, her legs moving in a wobbly rhythm.\\n\\nLuna's eyes sparkled with excitement as she realized she was actually crawling! Emma and her siblings cheered and clapped, \"Woo-hoo, Luna! Look at you go!\" Luna giggled and wobbled a little more, her tiny hands and feet finding their balance.\\n\\nAs the days went by, Luna became more confident, her crawling becoming smoother and more efficient. She'd scamper across the room, laughing and chattering to herself, her tail wagging like crazy (even though she didn't have a tail!).\\n\\nOne day, Luna's mom had had enough of Luna's endless crawling practice. \"Okay, kiddo,\" she said with a mischievous grin, \"time for an adventure!\" Emma pulled out a tiny stroller and gently helped Luna inside. Luna squealed with delight as Emma pushed her down the hallway, watching as her baby girl explored the world from a new perspective.\\n\\nLuna's first crawl was a milestone moment in her life. She realized that even the toughest challenges could be overcome with practice, patience, and a little bit of momma-love. And as she settled into her stroller, her mom by her side, Luna knew that this was just the beginning of a lifetime of adventures, discovery, and crawling into the heart of the fun.</td>\n",

Add:** Add the two products: 260 + 26 = 286\\n\\n\\n**Therefore, 22 * 13 = 286**  \n",
       "2  Bartholomew Buttercup, a cherub with an unruly tuft of blonde hair and a bottomless appetite for mashed sweet potatoes, was on a mission.  His mission? To conquer the floor.\\n\\nHe couldn't quite understand why his legs refused to move as one. The world was a fascinating place, just out of reach – fluffy rugs begging to be crawled upon, a sparkly mobile dangling enticingly, and the elusive comfort of Mom's lap. \\n\\nOne sunny afternoon, while his chubby fingers tugged at a dangling teething toy, an idea, bright and unyielding as the sun shining through the nursery window, struck Bartholomew. He pushed himself up, his eyebrows furrowing in concentration, and let out a triumphant gurgle. This, he decided, was the key.\\n\\nFor the next few hours, Bartholomew \"skated\" – a wobbly, jerky motion fueled by desperation and mashed sweet potato-induced energy. He propelled himself across the floor, arms flailing like windmill wings, legs kicking blindly. \\n\\nEach failed attempt resulted in a frustrating topple, met with tears that were swiftly soothed by a cooing melody from Mom, followed by gentle pats and encouraging \"good tries.\" \\n\\nFrustration was brewing. He wanted to be like his older sister, Lily, who glided across the floor like a gazelle on ice skates. But Bartholomew wasn't a gazelle. He was a Buttercup, and Buttercups, he decided, were meant to conquer the world, one wobbly crawl at a time.\\n\\nHe took a deep breath, remembering the way his sister moved. He watched her, his big brown eyes full of determination. \\n\\nSlowly, methodically, he began to coordinate his movements. One hand reached out, pushing against the rug. The other, mirroring the action, found purchase on the wooden floor. His legs, finally understanding their role, pushed down with surprising strength. \\n\\nHe felt a surge of triumph as he moved – not a jerky skate, but a smooth, controlled crawl. He was moving! He was conquering!\\n\\nA roar of glee erupted from his tiny throat. His legs pumped, propelling him across the room. He was a speedboat on a sunny sea, navigating the world with newfound freedom.\\n\\nHe stopped short, realizing his destination. Mom sat on the floor, a book open in her lap, humming a soft tune. \\n\\nWith a final burst of energy, Bartholomew reached her, collapsing into her open arms. \\n\\n\"Yay, Bartholomew!\" Mom exclaimed, her voice filled with pride. \"You crawled!\"\\n\\nBartholomew gurgled happily, his face flushed with exertion and triumph. He had conquered the floor. But more importantly, he had conquered the doubt, proving to himself that even the smallest Buttercup could achieve anything they set their mind to.  The world, now within reach, beckoned.  And Bartholomew Buttercup, he was ready.  \n",

Break down 13 into (10 + 3)\\n2. Multiply 22 by 10: 22 * 10 = 220\\n3. Multiply 22 by 3: 22 * 3 = 66\\n4. Add the two results together: 220 + 66 = 286\\n\\nSo, 22 * 13 is mentally calculable as 286.  \n",
       "5                                                 Once upon a time, in a cozy little house on a sunny street, there lived a baby named Luna. Luna was a bundle of energy, always moving, always exploring, and always getting into mischief. But there was one thing that Luna hadn't mastered yet: crawling.\\n\\nEvery day, Luna would watch her older siblings as they played, laughed, and crawled on all fours. She'd try to join in, but her little arms and legs would flail and flop, and she'd end up on her bottom, giggling.\\n\\nLuna's mom, Emma, would kneel down beside her and say, \"Don't worry, little one. You'll get it eventually.\" But Luna was determined to learn. She practiced and practiced, using the couch cushions as her launching pad to try and reach the toys on the floor.\\n\\nOne day, Emma had an idea. She grabbed a few colorful blankets and spread them out in front of Luna, creating a mini obstacle course. \"Try crawling over these, Luna!\" she exclaimed. Luna's eyes widened as she gazed at the blankets. This was the challenge she'd been waiting for.\\n\\nWith a determined look on her face, Luna started to move. At first, it was more like a flop than a crawl. Her arms and legs flailed wildly, and she fell onto her bottom with a tiny oof. But Emma was patient, cheering her on, \"Keep going, Luna! You're doing it!\"\\n\\nUndeterred, Luna tried again. This time, she managed to push herself forward with one hand and drag her other leg behind her. Then, suddenly, she found herself on all fours, her legs moving in a wobbly rhythm.\\n\\nLuna's eyes sparkled with excitement as she realized she was actually crawling! Emma and her siblings cheered and clapped, \"Woo-hoo, Luna! Look at you go!\" Luna giggled and wobbled a little more, her tiny hands and feet finding their balance.\\n\\nAs the days went by, Luna became more confident, her crawling becoming smoother and more efficient. She'd scamper across the room, laughing and chattering to herself, her tail wagging like crazy (even though she didn't have a tail!).\\n\\nOne day, Luna's mom had had enough of Luna's endless crawling practice. \"Okay, kiddo,\" she said with a mischievous grin, \"time for an adventure!\" Emma pulled out a tiny stroller and gently helped Luna inside. Luna squealed with delight as Emma pushed her down the hallway, watching as her baby girl explored the world from a new perspective.\\n\\nLuna's first crawl was a milestone moment in her life. She realized that even the toughest challenges could be overcome with practice, patience, and a little bit of momma-love. And as she settled into her stroller, her mom by her side, Luna knew that this was just the beginning of a lifetime of adventures, discovery, and crawling into the heart of the fun.  "
